# RxShift Changelog

Newest-first. One entry per build session. This file is updated after every commit and
is the fast-read reference for what shipped, what's pending, and what changed in
infrastructure. Full context lives in `CLAUDE.md`; infrastructure details in
`INFRASTRUCTURE.md`.

## 2026-06-15 — Schedule scroll fix: sticky header, reachable horizontal scrollbar, condensing chrome

### Shipped
- **Sticky day header + always-reachable horizontal scrollbar (the core fix).** The schedule grid is now a height-capped, internally-scrolling region (`overflow-auto` + a runtime-measured `max-height`). Previously the grid had no height cap and the whole page scrolled — and because `overflow-x` makes the box a scroll container on *both* axes, the `sticky top-0` header stuck to a box that itself scrolled off-screen, and the horizontal scrollbar lived at the bottom of a full-height box far below the viewport. Capping the height fixes both: the header stays pinned, the staff column stays frozen, and the horizontal scrollbar sits at the visible grid's bottom edge. (`components/app/schedule/schedule-grid.tsx`)
- **Condensing top chrome → slim strip (editor).** As you scroll the grid, the location/view pills, AI command bar, period toolbar, and open-flag list condense to one slim pinned strip — `Location · Period · Draft/Published · ⚠ N flags`; click it to bring the full controls back. Chrome is hidden via CSS (not unmounted) so the AI-bar input survives. Reclaims vertical space for the grid; grid height recomputes via a `ResizeObserver` on `document.body`. (`schedule-builder.tsx`, with the chrome now passed in from `schedule/page.tsx`.)
- **All-locations overview** got the same sticky-header + reachable-scrollbar fix per location section (`overflow-auto` + `max-h`, switched the table to `border-separate` so sticky cells work in Chrome, made the date header + corner sticky). (`all-locations-overview.tsx`)
- The week / 2-week / month views inherit the grid fix automatically (shared `ScheduleGrid`); condense is editor-only.

### Open
- UI/layout only — no schema, API, auth, or dependency changes.
- Verified in-browser (Mesa Vista/OptumRx demo tenant, dark mode): header sticks, scrollbar always reachable, condense/expand cycle, frozen staff column, all-locations sticky header. Clean: `tsc`, 45 vitest tests, `next build`. No new console errors (the remaining `<html>` hydration warning is the pre-existing dark-mode no-flash script — fires on every page, not from this change).

## 2026-06-15 — Docs: infra fingerprint moved to the C:\dev master doc

### Infrastructure
- Adopted `C:\dev\INFRASTRUCTURE.md` as the cross-entity source of truth for accounts/tiers/connectivity. This repo's `CLAUDE.md` now points there for the account fingerprint; the repo's own `INFRASTRUCTURE.md` stays as the RxShift **operational runbook** (DNS, email flow, M365 send-as, troubleshooting) so it travels with the product.
- RxShift account added to the `gh` CLI (SSH key `RxShiftGit`). Push nuance: `origin` is HTTPS — `gh auth switch --user RxShift` before pushing to `RxShift/RxShift`, or repoint `origin` to the SSH URL `git@github.com:RxShift/RxShift.git`.

## 2026-06-13 — Schedule UX, live board, branding & help overhaul

### Shipped
- **Schedule navigation:** always-visible **Create next period** button + prev/next steppers (you could not create a future period once one had shifts — the core bug). Sticky staff column **and** date header (the staff column was silently broken by `border-collapse`; grid is now `border-separate`). Opens on the period containing today and scrolls to today's column.
- **View selector (week / 2-week / month)** decoupled from the build cycle — browse any window with a clear published / draft / no-period column cutoff; editing still resolves to the underlying period. Grid extracted to a shared `ScheduleGrid`. Copy-forward relabeled "Copy last period's weekday pattern" with a confirm.
- **Out-of-ratio indicator:** fill-independent red ⚠ corner badge (the old ring vanished on reddish work-type colors).
- **Configurable live statuses:** per-tenant show/hide, rename, and counts-toward-ratio, in Settings → Statuses. Single source of truth in `lib/live-status-config.ts`; board + picker + alerts all read it. Defaults reproduce prior behavior.
- **Live out-of-ratio alerts:** new cron evaluates each zone's current slot (shared `lib/live-board.ts`), notifies managers in-app + gated email, with a 5-min grace + 60-min cooldown (`live_ratio_alert_state`).
- **Mobile-first My Schedule:** stacked agenda on phones, calendar grid at `sm:`+.
- **Light tenant branding:** owner-set accent color (overrides only the amber token, both modes, server-rendered, regex-validated) + logo URL in the sidebar; RxShift mark always shown + "powered by RxShift". No migration (branding JSONB existed).
- **Help:** `admin_only` column + RLS so platform-admin docs never reach tenants or the AI assistant; rewrote the misleading "Building a schedule" article; added 5 tenant + 4 admin articles.

### Schema
- `0015_live_status_config` — `live_status_config` + `live_ratio_alert_state` tables (RLS, grants) — applied
- `0016_help_admin_only` — `help_article.admin_only` column + `help_select` RLS rewrite — applied
- `0017_help_content_overhaul` — rewrite + new help articles — applied

### Infrastructure
- `vercel.json`: added `/api/cron/live-ratio-check` (`0 9 * * *`, daily). **Hobby rejects sub-daily crons and fails the whole deploy** — an every-minute schedule was the real cause of the "deploy won't start" troubleshooting on June 13 (PENDING hook job, no build). Keep it daily until the Vercel account is on Pro, then change to `* * * * *` for near-real-time alerts. The board badge stays real-time meanwhile; grace/cooldown state means a slower cadence only delays alerts.

### Review (multi-agent code review, fixes applied)
- **Tenant isolation in the alert cron:** `loadPeriodBundle` now scopes staff/work_type/ratio_rule/constraint_rule/time_off by the period's `tenant_id` — they relied on RLS, which the service-role cron bypasses, so the cron could have used another tenant's ratio rule. Fixed before any second ratio tenant exists.
- Range view `periodForDate` prefers the published period on overlap; `?anchor` date validated; statuses manager stores `null` when a label matches the built-in default; My Schedule still shows a held-but-disabled status; sidebar recovers when a bad logo URL is corrected.
- Verified clean: `tsc`, 45 vitest tests, `next build`.

### Open (status after this session)
- Pre-existing lint: 2 errors unrelated to this work (`app/app/(shell)/admin/page.tsx` prefer-const; `components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx` set-state-in-effect) — flag, not fixed.
- Browser/visual walkthrough of the new surfaces recommended before the next demo.
- Paid-plan upgrade (Vercel + Supabase) at first customer / confident deep trial → unlocks per-minute alert cadence, backups, uptime.

- Work-type colors: `work_type.color` + curated 16-swatch palette + `readableTextColor()` util
- Swatch picker in Settings → Work Types (EntityManager `"color"` field type)

### Infrastructure
- `origin` remote (RxShift/RxShift) unblocked: jamisonwest-ship-it added as GitHub collaborator
- DMARC TXT record added in Cloudflare — Jamison (confirmed)

## 2026-06-12 (evening) — Retail-ready pass

### Shipped
- Branded email everywhere: `brandedEmailHtml()` in `lib/email.ts` covers all known-user sign-ins and notifications; Supabase template only touches brand-new signups

- Reports page (`/app/reports`): 4 XLSX exports — compliance log, staff roster, schedule, audit (audit = owner-only)
- Billing scaffold: `lib/pricing.ts` + tenant billing columns + `isTenantEntitled()` enforcement point (permissive until Stripe connects)
- Go Live opens a manual subscription flow
- Legal drafts: `/terms` + `/privacy` — attorney review confirmed OK; "Draft" notices removed

### Schema
