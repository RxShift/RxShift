# RxShift Changelog

Newest-first. One entry per build session. This file is updated after every commit and
is the fast-read reference for what shipped, what's pending, and what changed in
infrastructure. Full context lives in `CLAUDE.md`; infrastructure details in
`INFRASTRUCTURE.md`.

## 2026-06-16 — Marketing homepage: real app screenshots (hero split, feature/Nevada imagery, live-board band)

Added real product screenshots to the marketing homepage (previously all text). Captured from the
local app with Playwright (banner-free via `?screenshot=true`), saved into the repo, and wired into
a restructured hero, the feature cards, the Nevada section, and a new live-board band. No schema, no
migrations.

### Shipped
- **Capture script** (`scripts/capture-screenshots.ts`, run via `npx tsx`): logs in
  programmatically as Frank (Mesa Vista owner_admin) via an admin magic link, temporarily clears
  Mesa Vista's branding so shots use RxShift's own brand (restores it after), and captures four
  1440×900 JPGs to `public/images/screenshots/` — schedule (all locations), compliance record
  (Spring Valley, compliant), dashboard (full-page so location cards show), and the live board. It
  best-effort also records a looping **`live-board.gif`** of the ratio recomputing when an on-shift
  tech is toggled to lunch (pure-JS encode: pngjs + gifenc, no ffmpeg).
- **Hero** (`components/hero.tsx`): centered → two-column split; the schedule screenshot on the
  right inside a browser-chrome frame (`components/browser-frame.tsx`). Copy/CTAs unchanged.
- **Feature cards** (`components/features.tsx`): each card gets a windowed screenshot header.
- **Nevada section** (`components/nevada-callout.tsx`): two-column with the compliance record inset.
- **Live-board band** (`components/live-board-showcase.tsx`): shows the GIF if present, else falls
  back to the static board screenshot (graceful — no broken state when the GIF isn't generated).
- `gifenc.d.ts` — minimal local types for gifenc (ships none).

### Infrastructure
- Dev deps added: `playwright` (+ chromium), `pngjs`, `gifenc`. No runtime/prod deps.

### Verified
- `tsc` clean, `next build` clean. Browser-reviewed on desktop + mobile widths (hero, feature
  cards, live-board band, Nevada all stack to one column on phones).

### Open
- The live-board **GIF isn't generated yet** — it needs a counting tech actually on shift at
  capture time (demo staff work ~9a–7p PT). Until then the band shows the static board image. Re-run
  `npx tsx scripts/capture-screenshots.ts` mid-day PT to produce it (a best-effort local timer is
  set for ~9:03 AM PT June 17). The other four screenshots are live now.

---

## 2026-06-16 — Off-shift presence, delete-leads, co-branding lockup, email-log copy, screenshot mode

Post-demo-review polish pass. No schema, no migrations.

### Shipped
- **Off-shift presence (schedule-derived).** The live board + "My status now" no longer
  default everyone to "Working." Presence is derived from the **published** schedule: you're
  "on shift" only if a published shift covers right now (tenant tz). Off shift → shown as
  **"Off shift"**, not counted (no clock-in). Fixes an emulated staffer showing "Working"
  before their shift. Also: the board now uses **published shifts only** (drafts no longer
  count), and a `live_status` is honored only if it was set **today** (a stale "Lunch" from
  yesterday no longer lingers). `lib/live-board.ts` (shared with the alert cron),
  `board/page.tsx` + `live-board.tsx`, `me/page.tsx` + `my-status-picker.tsx`; new
  `dateInTimeZone` helper in `lib/dates.ts`.
- **Delete leads (platform admin).** `deleteLead` in `lib/actions/crm.ts` + a confirm-by-name
  Danger Zone on the lead detail page. Notes cascade; email-log audit rows are kept by design.
- **Co-branding lockup.** Sidebar now separates the RxShift mark from a tenant logo with a thin
  divider + height alignment (`Rx·Shift │ Pharmacy`) instead of two marks colliding.
- **Email-log empty state.** Clearer copy explaining the log fills as the app sends mail.
- **`?screenshot=true`** hides both the platform "viewing as" banner and the demo/trial
  sub-banner for clean marketing captures (client-side, URL-only, not persisted). Extracted the
  demo banner to `components/app/demo-banner.tsx`.

### Verified
- `tsc` clean, 45 tests pass, `next build` clean. Browser (Mesa Vista demo): only on-shift staff
  show "Working" — everyone off-shift shows "Off shift"; `?screenshot=true` removes both banners;
  co-branding divider renders. Not yet pushed (Jamison drives push).

### Next (assessed, awaiting greenlight) — Build 2
- **Proactive compliance notifications** (daily cron digest of upcoming scheduled deficiencies)
  + **append-only compliance annotations** (pharmacy explains a deficiency without editing the
  immutable record). See docs/decisions.md.

## 2026-06-16 — Centralized email + email log + deliverability/error detection + feedback + demo-safe chrome

One build (workstreams A–G). Migrations 0019 (email_log) + 0020 (feedback) applied.

### Shipped
- **One send path.** All app email — notifications, sign-in links, the website
  demo form, feedback, system alerts — now flows through a single `sendEmail()`
  core in `lib/email.ts` (branding + safety gate + Resend + logging). The three
  prior direct-to-Resend doors became thin wrappers. There is no other path out.
- **Email log (platform-admin).** New `email_log` table records every send —
  status (sent/suppressed/redirected/failed/delivered/bounced/complained),
  recipient, subject, and the **actual rendered HTML**. `/app/admin/emails` lists
  + filters them and renders each email exactly as it went out (sandboxed iframe);
  xlsx export at `/api/admin/emails`. App-sent emails are tagged to their lead and
  shown on the lead detail page.
- **Deliverability + system-issue loop.** New signed Resend webhook
  (`/api/webhooks/resend`) updates the log on delivered/bounced/complained and,
  with send failures, files a `source='system'` entry into the **same feedback
  inbox** users post to — so detected problems and reported ones live in one place.
  `lib/system-report.ts` (`reportSystemIssue`) is loop-guarded and de-duped.
- **Lean feedback feature.** A Feedback button in the sidebar footer (bug / feature
  / feedback + optional screenshot) → `submitFeedback` → `/app/admin/feedback`
  triage (filter by status/source/kind, set status + internal note). Screenshots in
  a private `feedback` bucket. Notifies platform admin via the central email.
- **Demo-safe admin chrome.** The PLATFORM nav (Admin Console, Leads, Emails,
  Feedback) is hidden while emulating a tenant, the "viewing as" banner is slimmed
  (kept, as the admin's safety signal), and the demo sub-banner no longer reveals
  the internal redirect address to a prospect.
- **Demo alerts → `hello@`.** The website demo-request email now defaults to
  `hello@rxshift.io` (env `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL`) — team-visible once the shared mailbox
  receives (infra step below).

### Schema
- `0019_email_log` (applied): email_log; RLS enabled, no policies (service-role).
- `0020_feedback` (applied): feedback (source user|system); RLS enabled, no
  policies; private `feedback` Storage bucket.

### Infrastructure / config (see INFRASTRUCTURE.md + closeout)
- New env vars: `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (webhook signature), `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL`
  (demo-alert recipient; defaults to hello@), optional `PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAIL`
  (system/feedback alerts; defaults to jamison@jamisonwest.com).
- Manual: configure the Resend webhook endpoint; add the Cloudflare `hello@`
  forwarding rule so the shared mailbox receives demo alerts.

### Verified
- `tsc` clean, 45 vitest tests pass, `next build` clean, migrations applied + confirmed.
- **Deployed to production + verified end-to-end (June 16):** webhook route live with
  signature verification active (unsigned POST → 401); a live demo-form submission
  created a CRM lead + a logged email with the rendered body, and the Resend webhook
  updated it to `delivered`; admin email-log + feedback pages and the feedback modal
  confirmed in-browser; demo-safe chrome (Platform nav hidden while emulating) confirmed.
- **Config completed (June 16):** `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` set + webhook verified live;
  `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` set to `hello@rxshift.io`; Cloudflare routing rule
  `hello@rxshift.io → hello@jamisonwest.onmicrosoft.com` Active. Verified end-to-end:
  app demo-alerts AND external mail to hello@ both land in the RxShift shared mailbox;
  everything else still forwards to Jamison's personal inbox.

---

## 2026-06-16 — Brand email: M365 shared mailbox + DKIM/SPF (infra, no app code)

Set up `hello@rxshift.io` as a real branded sending identity and documented the whole
email flow. No app code changed this session — infra + docs only.

### Infrastructure (Microsoft 365 / Cloudflare)
- **`hello@rxshift.io` shared mailbox** in the jamisonwest.com tenant with Send As +
  Full Access (Jamison) and shared Sent Items (`MessageCopyForSentAsEnabled`). Replaces
  a rejected alias approach (alias send-as is desktop-broken and shows the primary addr).
- **Authenticated rxshift.io for M365 sending:** root SPF now includes
  `spf.protection.outlook.com`; M365 **DKIM** enabled (two `selector{1,2}._domainkey`
  CNAMEs → `…jamisonwest.p-v1.dkim.mail.microsoft`). Verified: Gmail shows
  `hello@rxshift.io`, no "via onmicrosoft.com." Resend's `send.rxshift.io` SPF/DKIM left
  intact (separate sender).

### Docs
- `INFRASTRUCTURE.md` email section rewritten: shared-mailbox setup, full **email-flow
  map** (app/Resend vs M365, inbound/outbound, demo-request crossover), reporting model,
  and a now-vs-later cost/scaling table. DNS table updated with DKIM + new SPF.
- `docs/decisions.md`: shared-mailbox-over-alias rationale + the two-stream model (MS
  prohibits BCC-archiving into a shared mailbox) + deferred items.

### Open (next build — moving to plan mode)
- In-app `email_log` table + admin report (durable record of every Resend send).
- Route the demo-request alert to the `hello@` shared mailbox (team-visible).
- Make the shared mailbox *receive* (send-only today); paid seats for Susie/RT when needed.

## 2026-06-15 — Punch list: expandable flags, approve-executes-request, staff self-service, logo upload

Follow-on pass after the schedule rebuild (commits 6a8ad97 → 7835867).

### Shipped
- **Schedule flags expand again.** The flag summary in the matrix toolbar is a
  button that opens the full flag list in a bounded modal (the rebuilt matrix had
  collapsed it to a non-expandable count).
- **Approving a time-off request now executes it.** On approval, `decideTimeOff`
  deletes the person's shifts inside the approved window so they actually come off
  the schedule (manager sees the gap and backfills); PTO then overlays those days.
  Previously an approved request left the person still scheduled.
- **Staff self-service photo.** `/app/me` gained a "Your photo" card. Avatar upload
  was reworked from a browser-client + RLS write into a single `uploadAvatar` server
  action (service role, self-or-manager authorization) so it also works under
  platform-admin "viewing as." Light/dark toggle and self request-submission already
  existed on the staff-facing surface.
- **Tenant logo file upload.** Branding settings now accept a logo file (not just a
  hosted URL): `uploadLogo` server action → private `avatars` bucket → 1-year signed
  URL stored in `branding.logo_url`, preserving the accent color. One accent color +
  logo is the confirmed branding depth (no secondary color).

### Email (investigated — no change needed)
- Traced "I approved a request but no manager email arrived." The code is correct:
  `submitTimeOff`/`logCallout` email every approver through the safety gate, and
  **both demo tenants already deliver.** Mesa Vista (`is_demo`) redirects all email
  to `mesa-demo@rxshift.io` → rxshift.io catch-all → Jamison. OptumRx Demo allowlists
  `jamison@jamisonwest.com`, `dr.monahan@yahoo.com`, `susie.monahan@optum.com`. Its
  only approver is Susan Monahan West, whose work email `susie.monahan@optum.com` is
  allowlisted — so the submission email **sends to Susie's real Optum inbox**, which
  is why Jamison didn't see it. To watch the email flow himself, demo on **Mesa
  Vista** (routes to his catch-all). Changing OptumRx routing is a deliberate
  decision (Susie is a real co-founder/buyer) — left as-is pending Jamison's call.

### Schema / Infrastructure
- None (reuses the `avatars` bucket from the rebuild pass).

---

## 2026-06-15 — Schedule rebuild: per-location ratio, unified matrix, departments, filters, avatars

Large pass (commits d0fdc06 → b95b2bf). Supersedes the scroll "condense" shipped
earlier the same day.

### Shipped
- **Ratio is per LOCATION; ratio zones removed entirely.** Everyone counting at a
  location counts together — the "ratio zone" sub-location was a modeling mistake.
  An isolated room is now just a separate location. The engine was already
  zone-agnostic, so this is mostly grouping by location instead of zone
  (validateBundle, buildComplianceRecords, live board, alert cron, reports, AI
  command, callout gap). Added a cross-location **double-booking** check.
- **Departments are tenant-level** (shared, not bound to a location), an optional
  tag on a shift, and a view filter. New tenant setting **"require a department on
  every shift"** (toggle in Settings → Locations & Departments). SPC Compounding
  became a department.
- **Unified, person-centric schedule matrix** is the new home. One grid across all
  locations: staff down the left, each shift tagged with its location. **All
  Locations is where you build**; selecting a location (or a department/work-type)
  is a **view filter** that shows only the matching, scheduled staff. The old
  per-location builder, the range view, and the "Edit period" mode are gone.
- **Periods are invisible plumbing.** Scheduling into a week with no period
  auto-creates the cycle-aligned period (ensurePeriodForDate; upsertShift no longer
  needs a period id). The All-Locations toolbar has **Publish** (publishWindow —
  every draft in the window, or just the filtered location), **Copy last week's
  pattern** (copyForwardWindow), and **Export CSV**. Creating a shift offers a
  **Location picker**. A status pill shows Published / Draft so you always know if
  you're looking at an active schedule or a draft.
- **Fixed-frame scroll** replaced the janky scroll-driven condense: compact header,
  the grid is the single scroll region (sticky day header, frozen staff column,
  horizontal scrollbar always reachable).
- **View filters:** department (single) + **work-type chips (multi-select)** —
  "show only Hospice Shift". (Group-by is covered by these filters for now.)
- **Staff avatars:** 1:1 crop (react-easy-crop) → 400px webp → private avatars
  Storage bucket (manager-only RLS) → shown as rounded squares in the staff list,
  the staff editor, and in front of every name in the schedule. Display via
  short-lived signed URLs.

### Schema
- `0018_per_location_ratio` (applied): drop ratio_zone (table, FKs, RLS); re-point
  compliance_snapshot + live_ratio_alert_state to location; department tenant-level
  (drop location_id); add tenant.require_department + staff.avatar_path; create
  private `avatars` Storage bucket + tenant-scoped RLS.

### Infrastructure
- New private Supabase Storage bucket `avatars` (tenant-scoped paths
  `{tenant}/{staff}-{ts}.webp`; manager-only writes; signed-URL reads).
- New dependency: `react-easy-crop`.

### Open
- **Publish UX** — Jamison has a question about the Publish button (TBD).
- **AI command bar** was removed from the schedule (it was period-bound); re-add
  bound to the window/all-locations later.
- **Multi-state / per-location ratio rules** deferred (one tenant rule today) —
  revisit when a cross-state prospect appears (see decisions.md).
- Real-photo avatar upload should be exercised by a normal manager login to confirm
  the storage RLS path end-to-end.
- Per-column published/draft tint (from the old range view) not carried into the
  matrix; the toolbar status pill covers it for now.

## 2026-06-15 — Schedule scroll fix: sticky header, reachable horizontal scrollbar, condensing chrome

### Shipped
- **Sticky day header + always-reachable horizontal scrollbar (the core fix).** The schedule grid is now a height-capped, internally-scrolling region (`overflow-auto` + a runtime-measured `max-height`). Previously the grid had no height cap and the whole page scrolled — and because `overflow-x` makes the box a scroll container on *both* axes, the `sticky top-0` header stuck to a box that itself scrolled off-screen, and the horizontal scrollbar lived at the bottom of a full-height box far below the viewport. Capping the height fixes both: the header stays pinned, the staff column stays frozen, and the horizontal scrollbar sits at the visible grid's bottom edge. (`components/app/schedule/schedule-grid.tsx`)
- **Condensing top chrome → slim strip (editor).** As you scroll the grid, the location/view pills, AI command bar, period toolbar, and open-flag list condense to one slim pinned strip — `Location · Period · Draft/Published · ⚠ N flags`; click it to bring the full controls back. Chrome is hidden via CSS (not unmounted) so the AI-bar input survives. Reclaims vertical space for the grid; grid height recomputes via a `ResizeObserver` on `document.body`. (`schedule-builder.tsx`, with the chrome now passed in from `schedule/page.tsx`.)
- **All-locations overview** got the same sticky-header + reachable-scrollbar fix per location section (`overflow-auto` + `max-h`, switched the table to `border-separate` so sticky cells work in Chrome, made the date header + corner sticky). (`all-locations-overview.tsx`)
- The week / 2-week / month views inherit the grid fix automatically (shared `ScheduleGrid`); condense is editor-only.

### Open
- UI/layout only — no schema, API, auth, or dependency changes.
- Verified in-browser (Mesa Vista/OptumRx demo tenant, dark mode): header sticks, scrollbar always reachable, condense/expand cycle, frozen staff column, all-locations sticky header. Clean: `tsc`, 45 vitest tests, `next build`. No new console errors (the remaining `<html>` hydration warning is the pre-existing dark-mode no-flash script — fires on every page, not from this change).

---

## 2026-06-15 — Docs: infra fingerprint moved to the C:\dev master doc

### Infrastructure
- Adopted `C:\dev\INFRASTRUCTURE.md` as the cross-entity source of truth for accounts/tiers/connectivity. This repo's `CLAUDE.md` now points there for the account fingerprint; the repo's own `INFRASTRUCTURE.md` stays as the RxShift **operational runbook** (DNS, email flow, M365 send-as, troubleshooting) so it travels with the product.
- RxShift account added to the `gh` CLI (SSH key `RxShiftGit`). Push nuance: `origin` is HTTPS — `gh auth switch --user RxShift` before pushing to `RxShift/RxShift`, or repoint `origin` to the SSH URL `git@github.com:RxShift/RxShift.git`.

---

## 2026-06-13 — Schedule UX, live board, branding & help overhaul

### Shipped
- **Schedule navigation:** always-visible **Create next period** button + prev/next steppers (you could not create a future period once one had shifts — the core bug). Sticky staff column **and** date header (the staff column was silently broken by `border-collapse`; grid is now `border-separate`). Opens on the period containing today and scrolls to today's column.
- **View selector (week / 2-week / month)** decoupled from the build cycle — browse any window with a clear published / draft / no-period column cutoff; editing still resolves to the underlying period. Grid extracted to a shared `ScheduleGrid`. Copy-forward relabeled "Copy last period's weekday pattern" with a confirm.
- **Out-of-ratio indicator:** fill-independent red ⚠ corner badge (the old ring vanished on reddish work-type colors).
- **Configurable live statuses:** per-tenant show/hide, rename, and counts-toward-ratio, in Settings → Statuses. Single source of truth in `lib/live-status-config.ts`; board + picker + alerts all read it. Defaults reproduce prior behavior.
- **Live out-of-ratio alerts:** new cron evaluates each zone's current slot (shared `lib/live-board.ts`), notifies managers in-app + gated email, with a 5-min grace + 60-min cooldown (`live_ratio_alert_state`).
- **Mobile-first My Schedule:** stacked agenda on phones, calendar grid at `sm:`+.
- **Light tenant branding:** owner-set accent color (overrides only the amber token, both modes, server-rendered, regex-validated) + logo URL in the sidebar; RxShift mark always shown + "powered by RxShift". No migration (branding JSONB existed).
- **Help:** `admin_only` column + RLS so platform-admin docs never reach tenants or the AI assistant; rewrote the misleading "Building a schedule" article; added 5 tenant + 4 admin articles.

### Schema
- `0015_live_status_config` — `live_status_config` + `live_ratio_alert_state` tables (RLS, grants) — applied
- `0016_help_admin_only` — `help_article.admin_only` column + `help_select` RLS rewrite — applied
- `0017_help_content_overhaul` — rewrite + new help articles — applied

### Infrastructure
- `vercel.json`: added `/api/cron/live-ratio-check` (`0 9 * * *`, daily). **Hobby rejects sub-daily crons and fails the whole deploy** — an every-minute schedule was the real cause of the "deploy won't start" troubleshooting on June 13 (PENDING hook job, no build). Keep it daily until the Vercel account is on Pro, then change to `* * * * *` for near-real-time alerts. The board badge stays real-time meanwhile; grace/cooldown state means a slower cadence only delays alerts.

### Review (multi-agent code review, fixes applied)
- **Tenant isolation in the alert cron:** `loadPeriodBundle` now scopes staff/work_type/ratio_rule/constraint_rule/time_off by the period's `tenant_id` — they relied on RLS, which the service-role cron bypasses, so the cron could have used another tenant's ratio rule. Fixed before any second ratio tenant exists.
- Range view `periodForDate` prefers the published period on overlap; `?anchor` date validated; statuses manager stores `null` when a label matches the built-in default; My Schedule still shows a held-but-disabled status; sidebar recovers when a bad logo URL is corrected.
- Verified clean: `tsc`, 45 vitest tests, `next build`.

### Open (status after this session)
- Pre-existing lint: 2 errors unrelated to this work (`app/app/(shell)/admin/page.tsx` prefer-const; `components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx` set-state-in-effect) — flag, not fixed.
- Browser/visual walkthrough of the new surfaces recommended before the next demo.
- Paid-plan upgrade (Vercel + Supabase) at first customer / confident deep trial → unlocks per-minute alert cadence, backups, uptime.

### Shipped
- App-only dark mode: `.dark` token overrides in `globals.css`; `ThemeToggle` in sidebar footer
- No-flash script gated to app context (`app.*` hostname / `/app` path) — marketing always renders light
- Manager Settings access: `scheduler`/`supervisor` can now edit org config, ratio rules; Danger Zone stays owner-only
- Work-type colors: `work_type.color` + curated 16-swatch palette + `readableTextColor()` util
- Swatch picker in Settings → Work Types (EntityManager `"color"` field type)
- Schedule grid: shift fill = work-type color + name; compliance separated to ring channel (red ring + ⚠ = deficient, amber ring = constraint)

### Infrastructure
- `origin` remote (RxShift/RxShift) unblocked: jamisonwest-ship-it added as GitHub collaborator
- DMARC TXT record added in Cloudflare — Jamison (confirmed)
- Branded Supabase magic-link template pasted in dashboard — Jamison (confirmed)

- Website screenshots/demo content — unblocked by Mesa Vista; format decision pending
- Vercel RxShift account authorization — phone verification pending with Vercel support
- Tennessee cert-dependent ratio enforcement — BLOCKED (contradictory rule research)
- README.md is still unmodified Next.js boilerplate — needs RxShift rewrite

---

## 2026-06-12 (evening) — Retail-ready pass

### Shipped
- Branded email everywhere: `brandedEmailHtml()` in `lib/email.ts` covers all known-user sign-ins and notifications; Supabase template only touches brand-new signups
- AI shift creation: `create_shifts` command via natural-language input (expanded/clamped/PTO-aware, engine-validated, confirm-to-apply)
- Copy-forward break_minutes bug fixed (was silently dropping break data)
- California ratio enforcement (BPC 4115, 2P−1 additive formula) in engine + tests + CA settings seed + `/states/california` page live (no "Coming Soon")
- CPhT tracking on staff profiles (informational; TN enforcement deferred)
- Board containment policy: RxShift never contacts a board; publish-time 3-day-streak alerts go to pharmacy's own managers only
- Reports page (`/app/reports`): 4 XLSX exports — compliance log, staff roster, schedule, audit (audit = owner-only)
- Billing scaffold: `lib/pricing.ts` + tenant billing columns + `isTenantEntitled()` enforcement point (permissive until Stripe connects)
- Go Live opens a manual subscription flow
- Legal drafts: `/terms` + `/privacy` — attorney review confirmed OK; "Draft" notices removed

### Schema
- `0011_billing_columns.sql` — tenant billing fields (plan, billing cycle, entitlement flag)

### Infrastructure
- Resend SMTP for Supabase Auth configured (sender typo `.com`→`.io` was causing 550 rejections — fixed)

### Open
- Stripe billing integration: enforcement point exists, permissive until webhook handlers + billing columns wired
- Owner-facing alias management UI: scripts-only for now
- Shared rate limiting on `/api/auth/login-link` and `/api/contact` before public launch

---

## 2026-06-12 — Phase 2: CRM, demo mode, Mesa Vista, website expansion, demo identities

## 2026-06-12 (morning) — Tenant lifecycle, login aliases, unpaid breaks, onboarding polish

### Shipped
- Tenant lifecycle: `tenant.status` (setup→trial→live) + `email_allowlist` — gate in `lib/email-policy.ts`; `sendNotificationEmail()` enforces all send rules; Go Live card in Settings
- Amber trial banner across the app for non-live tenants
- Login aliases: `login_alias` table; `POST /api/auth/login-link` + `GET /app/auth/confirm` token-hash flow; survives Outlook link scanners
- Manage aliases: `npx tsx scripts/provision-user.ts --add-alias <email> --for <primary>`
- Susie's login: dr.monahan@yahoo.com (home/phone) ↔ susie.monahan@optum.com (work), same account
- Unpaid breaks: `shift.break_minutes` + `tenant.default_break_minutes`; paid-hours math subtracts per shift; ratio coverage untouched
- `scripts/seed-live-now.ts` — seeds `live_status` from today's real shifts so the live board looks alive during demos
- `scripts/provision-user.ts` — provision a login to an existing tenant by email/tenant/staff/role; `--delete-auth-user` cleanup
- Live board + helpers compute "now"/"today" in tenant.timezone via `nowInTimeZone()` in `lib/dates.ts`
- Schedule defaults to the published period for the first location

### Schema
- `0006_email_safety.sql` — `tenant.status` + `tenant.email_allowlist`
- `0007_login_alias.sql` — `login_alias` table
- `0008_break_minutes.sql` — `shift.break_minutes` + `tenant.default_break_minutes`

### Infrastructure
- Orphan auth user jamison.west@outlook.com deleted
